    <td>I watched the teacher and copied his code, when it didn't work i seeked help and got it fixed. Then i copied a friend and almost got my discount codes to work but somehow they still don't work.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I was limited by the formula for the discount codes. I just couldn't get it to work, i copied exactly what was on my friends computer but it just wouldn't work. I need to work on making code myself instead of copying my friends.</td>

    <td>Next time i would have a working formula. To improve my learning i will try not to copy my friends work as much and focus on my own.</td>
