(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Mainly by focused listening and watching a demonstration. 
I learned that to find your account and see your posts you can search Youraccountname.github.io

I easily created a github account and easily posted my first post which is the post before this one.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The first set of instructions went well, although I managed to get confused when the program showed up a slightly different version of the information and I got distracted by menus that weren't relevant.  

I also got caught up with my avatar icon as it would take a while for it to show up.

I need to work on my knowledge on github as a whole because I got caught up in all the different buttons and destinations for the Jekyll script.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pay a bit more attention and make lots of notes.
Seek help from others if I struggle.

I can improve my learning by using GitHub in my free time to get the hang of it.

I have also created a doc that me and my friends in the IT group will contribute to. Its purpose is that we will put on it what we know about GitHub and any secrets/shortcuts.</td>
