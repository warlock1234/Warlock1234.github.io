  <tr>
    <td>I listened and watched our teacher instruct us how to add boxes and shadows for those boxes around the title and posts. I then explored a bit and found out that the most effective backgrounds are the largest size available image, so a 1980 by 2000 will fill up more than a 360 by 400 image. I also learned how to set an email in the About area so people can contact me and I edited my details zone.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Much of the code i still don't understand and i still havnt been on any code apart from the config and style one. I was also interrupted a lot by people who couldn't do github for the life of them, most of these people couldn't understand why their changes weren't being made and as soon as i got to them i went on their github home reloaded it once and the changes were there.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to focus more on my work more than others and will ask our teacher (if i'm brave enough) If i'm stuck or want to do more. Me and my friend so far have been working well together and help each other out a lot but next week i plan to do much more.</td>
