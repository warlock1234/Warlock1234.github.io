**This Weekâ€¦**

This weeks lesson was cancelled due to sports day. We all had to go out and do sporting events for our house. In the end my house, thorne, came 4th in the days events but 5th over the entire year and like usual pearson won. But after that we had some special events, such as the house captains sack race and the teacher relay, which had some special moments such as Mr Walter falling over :(

But anyway, that's all for this week.
