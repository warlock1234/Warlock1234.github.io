    <td>I watched our teacher and did (almost) everything he did to the letter. I did have to ask him to show us a piece of the formula. I frequently looked at the teacher's work which really helped me.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was limited by the formula itself. I just couldn't get it to work, i copied exactly what was on the board but it just wouldn't work. I should probably work on remembering what the teacher says ordo it at the same time as he does it.</td>

    <td>Next time i would have a working formula. To improve i would be able to copy the teacher first before trying my own way.</td>
