**This Week:**

This lesson i learned how to create a secret code. To do this you must first create a cypher. A cypher is what your words will 'translate to', this is the alphabet on one side of the screen and what each letter will be next to it. So a could be a j or even a 4.

Here is my cypher:

Next you need to make an en/decrypter. This is where you use vlookup to change what you type in, into an encrypted message and that you can but in the decrypter and will become the original message again, so far i haven't been able to make the decrypt part work but i plan to do that next lesson.

Here is my encryption machine!:
