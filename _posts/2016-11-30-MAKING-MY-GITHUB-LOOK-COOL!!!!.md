**Making the GitHub look good!!!!**

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/3VaywlMr5mkAhGjBSsOY4Q_img_0.jpg)

To day I managed to add a background to my GitHub blog and change the colour of my text.

To change the background I copied the link of an image and made sure it was a .jpg file. Then I went onto the style.scss file and edited the file. Where it said Background: I deleted the old link and typed: url( (then I pasted the image link here) ) so it looked like:

url(dsjdsj.csh subculture.ceunceuhwf.jpg). 

After a while when I reloaded the home page for my account it replaced the white background with the image of choice.

I then decided to change the colour of my text. I found a colour slider on google and picked the colour red, I copied the number correlating to the colour which was e50000. Then I went back onto the style.scss file and replaced all text colours such as #$white with #e50000, apart from a few.

So far I have not been able to replace the fonts but I plan to do so in the future and change my text colour to a more likeable colour and not the shade of red it is at the moment.
