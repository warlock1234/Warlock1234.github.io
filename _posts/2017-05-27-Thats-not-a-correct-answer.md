**This Weekâ€¦**

I added code that doesn't allow you to choose an number other than the selected few in the question that you're meant to answer with. E.g 1,2 or 3. This means that the end percentage cannot be over 100%. Overall this allows the quiz to feel better made.

Try it here:
<script src="//repl.it/embed/Hdh7/6.js"></script>
