This week…

This week I learned how to embed videos and google sheets to a github post without it showing as a link. For a video you need to post a post first then find the youtube video, click 'share' and then ’embed’ and copy the whole link, then edit your post and paste the link where you want it.

For google sheets you must press 'file' then ‘publish to web’ and make sure you click ’embed’ and then just like for a youtube video, copy and paste the link in a post.

BUT MAKE SURE YOU DON'T PASTE THE LINK ANYWHERE IN THE CODE OF THE POST AS IT WILL BREAK IT ONLY PUT IT AFTERWARDS OR MAKE A BREAK IN THE CODE THAT WILL STILL ALLOW THE POST TO WORK.

Here's an example of an embedded video:
