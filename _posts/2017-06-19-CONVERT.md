**This weekâ€¦**

I made a python code that converts imperial units to metric units. Firstly it asks you what conversion you would like to make, e.g miles-kilometres, gallons-litres etc. then you type in a number and it converts it. The only thing that needs changing is that the code comes up with an error, even when it works, so i would like to fix that.
